[Online index](https://wholeprattcatalog.com/) and physical bookmarks imposing the network of Stewart Brand’s 1968 catalog upon the Pratt Institute library.



Stemming from buttons that read “Why haven’t we seen a photograph of the whole Earth yet,” Stewart Brand’s Whole Earth Catalog presented its audience with an index of resources and tools centered around notions of self-sufficiency, alternative education, and similar interests within the era’s counterculture. Though many of the resources presented within the catalog have since lost their immediate potency, the ethos of the catalog has lost little relevance; the WEC’s mission, providing access to tools, is as important in the digital age as it was in the late ‘60s. By building Whole Pratt Catalog as a system to connect individual texts within the Institute’s library, the curatorial hand of Brand lives on beyond its original incarnation.
